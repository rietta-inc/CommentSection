# The Comments Section Demo App

This is a demo application for educational purposes. It's intended to show the use of
- test driven development
- integration tests via Capybara/Selenium to exercise functionality from the point of view of a user
- CircleCI to run automated tests in a Dockerized environment for each Git pull request
- protected branches in GitHub to require tests to pass before merge
